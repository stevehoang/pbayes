Description: The core functionality of pbayes fits a mixture of n beta distributions (one of which is uniform) 
    to a given set of p-values. Bayes' rule is then used to calulate the probability that a given p-value from 
    the set is associated with the non-uniform component of the mixture distribution. Since p-values are 
    uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, the aformentioned probability can be interpreted as the 
    Bayesian posterior probability that the alternative hypothesis is true. These probabilites can be combined 
    using the standard rules of probability to perform composite hypothesis tests.
