Description: A set of independent p-values can be modeled as draws from a mixture of beta distributions.
    This package provides tools to estmate such a mixture given some data. One component of the
    mixture is necessarily uniform, representing p-values corresponding to true null hypotheses. 
    The non-uniform components of the mixture represent tests where the alternative hypothesis
    is true. Using the method described by Allison et al. (2002), p-values are converted to Bayesian 
    posterior probabilities using mixture models and Bayes' rule. This Bayesian posterior probability
    can be interpreted as the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true. These probabilities 
    can be combined using the standard rules of probability to perform composite hypothesis tests, as
    described by Erikson, Kim, and Allison (2010).
