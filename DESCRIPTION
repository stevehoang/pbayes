Description: The core functionality of pbayes fits a mixture of a single uniform distribution and 
    n beta distributions to a given set of p-values. Bayes' rule is then used to calulate the probability
    that a given p-value from the set is associated with the non-uniform component of the mixture
    distribution. Since p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, the aformentioned
    probability can be interpreted as the Bayesian posterior probability that the alternative hypothesis
    is true. These probabilites can be combined using the standard rules of probability to perform 
    composite hypothesis tests.
